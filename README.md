## Gorilla Cards is the new way to create, organize, and study flash cards. Its main functionality is based on Anki but with a modern touch.

 From our perspective, education and learning should be fun. In that viewpoint, we are creating modern version of flashcard apps with gamification elements. It's now in the kitchen and cooking...

# Differences from Anki

First of all, Anki is an excellent application. We use it daily. But, it is a desktop application, yes, it has web support, but it is constrained. Anki was created 16 years ago; at that age, web applications were not very flexible and popular as today. Unlike Anki, Gorilla Cards is an online service. You don't have to sync your cards because cards are on the cloud.

The second difference, Anki doesn't have gamification elements such as a leaderboard, Streaks, badges, etc.

The third and most crucial difference, Gorilla Cards has a social experience. You can share cards with friends, work together, and create competition.
